# Variant files for Meshtastic (not tested)

It is possible to use Meshtastic on spare or unused LoRaPRS boards by simply copying or creating symlinks to directories above into the Meshtastic `variants/esp32c3/diy/` or `variants/esp32/diy/`. After that, select one of configurations, build Meshtastic and upload.
